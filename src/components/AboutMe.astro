        🌟 Hi there! I'm Arumi, a vibrant soul with a lifelong flair for
        creativity. From doodling in my childhood to diving headfirst into the
        exhilarating world of UX and product design, my journey has been a
        kaleidoscope of colors and ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        🚀 What gets me up in the morning? The thrill of untangling complex
        design puzzles! I'm all about blending usability, aesthetics, and
        business objectives to craft solutions that don't just work but sing.
      </p>
      <p>
        📚 When I'm not designing, you'll find me lost in the fantastical realms
        of fantasy novels. It's the limitless imagination, the ability to
        visualize worlds unseen, and the endless inspiration I draw for my
        design work.
      </p>
      <p>
        🌐 I’m passionate about paving the way for others and dedicated to
        educating aspiring tech enthusiasts. Fueling this passion, I've launched
        a UX and product design blog, sharing bite-sized wisdom through TikTok
        and other social media platforms.
