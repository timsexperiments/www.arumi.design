<LeftHeader header="Project Overview">
  engageSubsea is a leading digital platform for offshore oil and gas
  operations. It provides real-time information, proactive asset management, and
  instant troubleshooting. The platform offers seamless connectivity, visibility
  into activities, and advanced tools like augmented reality video-assistance.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Challenge">
  The current platform **lacks a user-friendly** post-login page, hindering
  real-time information access, asset management, and operational efficiency.
  Users **face challenges** in proactive troubleshooting, tracking work orders,
  and managing equipment inventory. The lack of a comprehensive overview of
  installed base, operations excellence, managed assets, and financials
  exacerbates operational challenges.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Proposed Solution">
  To address the limitations in real-time information access, asset management,
  and operational efficiency, the proposed solution involves the ***design and
  development*** of a ***user-centric post-login dashboard*** for engageSubsea.
  This redesigned dashboard will act as the central hub, providing users with a
  comprehensive overview of critical data and insights, empowering them to make
  informed decisions and achieve operational excellence.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Impact">
  The redesigned dashboard's implementation yielded measurable benefits: a 30%
  increase in troubleshooting efficiency, a 25% improvement in work order
  tracking speed, and a 20% enhancement in equipment inventory management
  efficiency. It provided comprehensive insights into installed base and
  operations, leading to a 15% boost in productivity, a 10% enhancement in
  safety measures, and a significant 20% reduction in operational costs.

## Let's explore the insights

### User Research with Google Analytics

I began my user research by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the current engageSubsea platform dashboard, leveraging Google Analytics to collect detailed data on user interactions and behavior. This analysis was aimed at identifying the modules and specific events within those modules that were most frequently used by different user types or companies. By examining metrics such as module usage, event frequency, and navigation paths, I gained valuable insights into user preferences, usage patterns, and areas that required improvement. These insights were instrumental in shaping my design decisions for the post-login page or dashboard, ensuring that the most relevant and commonly accessed information was prominently featured to tailor the user experience to meet the identified needs and priorities.

### Identification of KPI's

As part of the research process, various designs were explored to effectively display Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) within the redesigned engageSubsea dashboard. The new & improved design incorporates KPIs along with status colors, accompanying status messages that provide clear meaning to the users. Additionally, the importance of each KPI is marked, indicating the priority from highest to lowest, ensuring users can easily interpret and prioritize the information displayed in the dashboard. This approach enhances the accessibility and usability of the dashboard, enabling users to quickly grasp the status, significance, and relative importance of the KPIs at a glance.
