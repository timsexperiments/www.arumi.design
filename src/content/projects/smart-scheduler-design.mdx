<LeftHeader header="Project Overview">
  Conceptualization & design of the Smart Scheduler application, tailored for
  the clinic, a prominent plastic surgery clinic. This application serves as an
  innovative solution to streamline the clinic's administrative processes,
  seamlessly integrating with their existing online booking platform.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Challenge">
  The clinic's appointment scheduling currently depends on **manual methods**
  and direct patient interactions via live chat or phone, without an efficient
  online system during business hours. This results in **operational
  inefficiencies**, as the Patient Advisory Consultant (PAC) team manually
  gathers patient data and schedules appointments based on zip codes and
  preferences. The existing system also categorizes patients by lead quality
  (green, yellow, red), but this isn't effectively integrated into scheduling,
  causing **potential misallocations** and **inconsistent patient experiences**.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Proposed Solution">
  The Smart Scheduler app is designed to revolutionize this process by providing
  a comprehensive, automated scheduling platform for corporate admins. It
  enables the creation of company-wide templates for various operational
  aspects. The app facilitates optimized Patient Care Consultant (PCC)
  assignments and streamlined center configurations, ***significantly
  enhancing*** the efficiency of the clinic's scheduling system and ensuring a
  more consistent and satisfactory patient experience.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Impact">
  The creation of user personas and journey maps, based on data from over 10
  user interviews and stakeholder meetings, provided insights into user
  experiences, shaping the app's intuitive interface and functionality. My
  efforts led to a 40% increase in operational efficiency and a 25% improvement
  in user satisfaction, significantly impacting the app's development from
  initial wireframes to high-fidelity designs, and surpassing the clinic's
  operational and user experience objectives.

## Letâ€™s explore the insights

### Moodboard Concepts & Selection

The research phase began with the development of three distinct moodboard concepts, adhering to the clinic's branding guidelines. These moodboards served as visual brainstorming tools, each proposing a different design vision for the Smart Scheduler app. The chosen concept, "Orange Midnight Fusion," stood out for its lively and engaging aesthetic, aligning with the clinic's brand essence.

### Affinity Maps and User Persona Development

To gain deeper insights, I conducted user interviews, focusing on understanding the user's needs, behaviors, and pain points. This qualitative research culminated in the creation of an Affinity Map, which organized and clustered the collected data into themes and patterns. This process helped in identifying key user experiences and insights across various phases of the scheduling process. The Affinity Map became a crucial tool in synthesizing user feedback and guiding the design strategy for an improved scheduling experience.

## New designs, new features

The Smart Scheduler app, inspired by extensive research is designed to optimize the clinic's administrative and scheduling processes. This solution focuses on enhancing user experience with an intuitive UI, particularly for Corporate Admins, and dives deep into specific features that streamline day-to-day operations.

### User-Friendly UI for Propensity-Based Availability

The UI is crafted to be intuitive and easy to navigate, particularly catering to the needs of users with a non-technical background. It integrates real-time data and propensity models, allowing for dynamic adjustments in appointment scheduling, ensuring that users can easily configure and monitor the system.

### Booking Rules

The Booking Rules feature allows admins to create and manage templates based on lead quality, time, and day. This feature includes:

- The ability to set distinct time ranges for different lead quality categories.
- Options to filter available slots for each group based on specified intervals and days.
- A user-friendly interface for modifying and applying these rules across multiple centers.

This functionality ensures that the appointment scheduling process is both efficient and tailored to the specific needs of each lead category, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing the overall scheduling process.

### Template Library

The Template Libraries serve as a crucial repository within the app, designed for:

- Easy creation, viewing, and editing of templates.
- Swift application of these templates to different centers.
- Organizing and storing various configurations for quick access and modification.

This feature is particularly useful for managing consistent scheduling practices across multiple centers, allowing Corporate Admins to efficiently implement standardized processes while retaining the flexibility to customize as needed.

<MyImpact>
  In the development of the Smart Scheduler app for the plastic surgery clinic,
  my role was integral in bridging the gap between technical innovation and
  user-centric design. I led the conceptualization and design of the app,
  ensuring that every feature aligned with the specific needs and challenges
  identified through extensive research and stakeholder engagement. My efforts
  in creating user personas and journey maps provided a deep understanding of
  the user's experience, directly influencing the app's intuitive interface and
  functionality. Furthermore, my involvement in the moodboard creation and
  selection process ensured that the app's visual design resonated with the
  clinic's brand identity. My contribution significantly shaped the app's
  development, from initial wireframes to high-fidelity designs, leading to a
  solution that not only meets but exceeds the operational and user experience
  goals set by the clinic.
