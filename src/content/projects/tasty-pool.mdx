<LeftHeader header="Project Overview">
  I designined a concept for a mobile social media application dedicated to the
  culinary community. As a designer, I focused on creating an engaging and
  intuitive user experience for food enthusiasts to share, discover, and engage
  with recipes. The project showcases my mobile design skills through a
  detailed, interactive prototype that simulates the app's functionality and
  user interactions.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Challenge">
  The primary challenge was differentiating Tasty Pool in the saturated market
  of social media and recipe sharing platforms, where users often struggle with
  navigation, content discovery, and community engagement. Existing platforms
  lack specialized features for recipe sharing, leading to a disjointed user
  experience and reduced platform interaction.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Proposed Solution">
  My design solution for Tasty Pool showcases a clean, user-friendly interface
  that streamlines the process of recipe uploading and boosts content discovery
  with personalized recommendations. At the heart of the design are interactive
  community features, such as recipe engagement & sharing capabilities, which
  nurture a strong sense of connection among users. The prototype allows users
  to fully experience the app's functionality, including the creation and
  sharing of a recipe.
</LeftHeader>

<LeftHeader header="Impact">
  The working prototype of Tasty Pool serves as a tangible representation of the
  app's potential to transform the recipe sharing experience. It aims to
  demonstrate how thoughtful design can address user needs, improve engagement,
  and build a lively culinary community. Success indicators for the project
  include positive feedback from user testing sessions, highlighting the
  prototype's ease of use, engaging features, and overall design aesthetic. By
  addressing key user experience challenges, the Tasty Pool design project
  underscores the importance of specialized, community-focused features in
  driving the success of social media platforms in niche markets.

## Let's explore the insights

### Moodboard Concepts & Selection

In the early stages of conceptualizing Tasty Pool, I created a mood board that served as a visual foundation for the app's aesthetic and emotional appeal. Central to this mood board were the chosen color palettes, carefully selected to embody the warmth, energy, and community spirit of Tasty Pool.

The choice of vibrant red and soft peach colors was key to creating a design that mixes excitement with comfort, showing the lively yet inviting spirit of the culinary community. We paired these colors with Proxima Nova typography for its clear and modern look, making sure the app speaks to users in an approachable yet refined way. This mood board not only guided the visual direction of Tasty Pool but also served as a constant reference throughout the design process, ensuring every element aligns with the initial vision of a cohesive, user-centered experience. Through this deliberate combination of colors and typography, the mood board laid the groundwork for a platform that invites users to explore, share, and connect over their love for food, fostering a sense of belonging and engagement within the Tasty Pool community.

### Site Map Overview

The site map represents the backbone of Tasty Pool, a social media app designed for sharing and discovering recipes. It outlines the app’s comprehensive information architecture, demonstrating the organization of content and features to foster an intuitive user experience. Creating the site map was key to devising a user-friendly navigation that enriches the app's usability by ensuring easy access to its core features like recipe discovery and community interaction. I identified Tasty Pool’s main features and organized them into a clear hierarchy, using digital tools and feedback from peers and potential users to refine the design. The site map was essential for a well-structured design, aiding in overcoming challenges related to content depth and navigational ease, thereby improving user experience.

### Wireframes

After conducting a thorough Competitive Audit to understand the landscape and differentiate Tasty Pool in the crowded recipe-sharing space, I moved to translate these insights into tangible designs. This section showcases the initial wireframes that laid the groundwork for Tasty Pool's user interface. These wireframes are the visual translation of my strategic planning, incorporating lessons learned from the competitive landscape and the structural blueprint provided by our site map.

By developing these wireframes, I aimed to create an intuitive and user-friendly navigation system that encourages recipe exploration and community interaction. This early visual planning was critical in identifying potential design challenges and ensuring a seamless user experience. The wireframes served as a pivotal tool for iterating design concepts, facilitating discussions with stakeholders, and refining the app's functionality and aesthetic appeal. Through this process, I crafted a design that not only meets user needs but also stands out in a competitive market, reinforcing Tasty Pool's commitment to a community-driven culinary experience.
